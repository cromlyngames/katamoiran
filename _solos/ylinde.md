*Ylinde* is sort of traditional science fiction sword & sorcery, with psionics subbing for a lot of the "sorcery". Mix in bits of 17th and 18th century England. Genetic engineering and mad scientists and the fragility of life. Maybe not so traditional, now that I think of it.

A good portion of it is pre 1.0 and kind of rough, but I'll post it eventually.
