#### The Theme

This is the actual framework of the blog (but not the content). The theme. It is heavily inspired by [Jekyll Experiment](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/jekyll-experiment), which is MIT-licensed. I started from scratch but couldn't have finished this theme (which I'm calling "rgk" for "red-gray-knight") without that one. The archive page, especially.

All my work on the rgk theme is also MIT-licensed.

Blog theme images (header, icons) are licensed CC0 and originally from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [OGA](http://opengameart.org/content/some-characters-by-ragewortt-in-vector).

#### The Blog Contents

The actual text (the content, the words) of the blog, including but not limited to the contents of the collections folders and the posts folder, is all rights reserved, copyright me, exposit.

If you want to use something and it's not covered by fair use, contact me.

#### The Scripts

Any standalone scripts should have an explicit header that details their terms of use and authorship (generally MIT and me). If not, contact me and let me know!
