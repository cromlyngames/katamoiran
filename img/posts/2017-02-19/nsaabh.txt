INTRODUCTION
What follows is a set of rules that shall be used in addition to your Solo RPG when you want to play a
mystery adventure of any kind. Your character proceeds in the investigation in nine climaxing steps and
neither your PC nor you know the truth until the grand ﬁnale.
The same adventure is replayable because there is less than 1% chance to get the same solution. You can
also base your adventure on your favorite book or movie.

How? Basically you create an enigma and different solutions before playing, shufﬂe some cards, then you
grab your favorite Solo RPG, make your Playing Character and start your adventure. During playing you
draw some cards, maybe you throw a dice, drink a beer...things like that.

Confused? Hey, this is only an introduction, you can skip it and go to the rules.

Enjoy.

 

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

1) A deck of poker cards (actually you need only 16 of them)
2) An envelope

3) Writing tools

4) A solo RPG system of your choice

5) Dices or other random generators as needed

 

MAKE A MYSTERY

‘A writer is someone who can make a riddle out of an answer. ’
Karl Kraus

Create an enigma to be solved, formed by 3 questions to be answered by the PC.

Associate each question with one suit from Clubs, Diamonds and Spades.

Make a numbered list of 5 possible answers for each question.

Make a numbered list of 3 possible Special Events. These are red herrings, plot twists, hostile actions or
subsequent crimes committed by the villain (The "Surprise List").

FORM THE CLUE DECK

Form three stacks, each with the ﬁrst five cards of the same suit (ace,2,3,4,5).

Shufﬂe each stack (Clubs, Diamonds and Spades).

Extract from each stack one card and put it in the envelope without looking (the 3 cards are the real
solution).

Gather the remaining cards into a single stack (The "Clue Deck“).

Add the Ace of Hearts (The "Bloody Heart") to the deck as a wild card.

Shufﬂe the Clue Deck.

 

NINE STEPS

When you use NSAABH the adventure is always formed by 9 steps, each step is a part of your adventure
in which your character is able to ﬁnd enough inforrnations to discard a clue of the mystery and advance
in the investigation.

PLAY THE GAME

‘Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth. ’
Sherlock Holmes-The Sign of Four

Create your PC and use your solo rpg system to play the adventure.

1) During the scene when your PC is ready to investigate, extract a card from the Clue Deck and put it
aside to form the Discard Pile.

2) If the card drawn is the "Bloody Heart" card, in the scene enter the ﬁrst special event not yet used of the
Surprise List, then draw a new card.

3) If there are no more unused special events in the Surprise List then put the "Bloody Heart" card aside,
otherwise put the "Bloody Heart" card in the Clue Deck again and shufﬂe.

4) Roleplay the scene to exclude the clue showed in the card. The Scene doesn't end until the clue is
proven false, the PC is always successful.

5) In one of the ﬁrst three scenes your PC must roll for a special investigation test using the rules of your
RPG system, if the PC succedes then you extract an additional card from the Clue Deck. You decide
during the play when your PC tries this special test.

6) Repeat phases (1 to 5) for the 3 central scenes
7) Repeat phases (1 to 5) for the 3 ﬁnal scenes

8) At the end of the last scene your PC must provide the solution of the enigma

- If the Clue Deck is empty it means that your PC solved the enigma by deduction: check the
discarded cards, the 3 missing cards are the solution

- If the Clue Deck is not empty your PC is forced to use his intuition or luck: choose one of the
combination of 3 undiscarded answers

9) Look at the clue cards in the envelope to get the solution.

10) Decide what are the consequences of the investigation

 

IF YOU HAVE TO STOP THE GAME

If you interrupt your game and continue later simply write down a list of the discarded clue cards (plus
cards of Mr. Maybe's solution, if any), at this point you can pick up all the cards and reform the poker
deck.

When you resume the game, form the Clue Deck and the solution again with the initial cards but without
those that you had previously written down in the list.

 

ADVANCED RULES:

Special NPCs:
There are 3 types of NPC you can use to add ﬂavor to the investigation, the names used are placeholders,
the actual NPC can be every character, gender, profession, species you want :

- Mr.Wrong: An NPC usually with some authority, he investigate the mystery and he is the character
who provides the first solution in the last scene but his solution is always wrong.

. Mr.Maybe: It is the NPC who provides the second solution in the last scene, his solution has been
randomly chosen before the adventure begins. There is less than 1% chance he is right but if he does
he takes all the merits even if your PC agree with him.

. Mr,Right: If your PC failed, this NPC provides the correct solution of the enigma at the very end of
the story

Bloody Heart Bonus Test:
If your PC failed a Special Investigation Test, he can roll it again when an event of the Surprise
List happens.

Evidence/Alibi Generator:

When you discard a clue card you have to improvise why that clue is not good or your PC has to
demonstrate his hypotesis, you can use your imagination or use the oracle (random generator) of your
Solo RPG. For a more speciﬁc generator you can roll M6 and check this table:

Witness

Trace

Different Time

Different Place
Document/Information
Special (i.e. Incapability)
