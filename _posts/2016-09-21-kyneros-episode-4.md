11/09: You'll notice I'm really bad at Scarlet Heroes, especially combat; it takes me ages to learn a new system. I won't start doing damage correctly consistently for like three more campaigns -- about the same time I added notes on the four major rolls needed in Scarlet Heroes.

*Being the fourth part of the adventure of Kai Valeyn, a man without a country, adrift seventeen centuries after the fall of his civilization, as he explored the now dangerous and wild lands he once called home.*

<!--more-->

*Scene over. That's two sessions, so two xp, I think, I'll double check.*

*Woohoo, level 2!*

*Ok, all leveled up.*

*So, morning of the second day of travel. I'm knocking off vent and time elapsed at day's end.*

*First, let's roll up the terrain for the new area. Still seed 5.*

*[Terrain] hills (1)*

*Fair enough, let's roll for encounter, feature, and event.*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  1  ] 1*

*That's another encounter. Hahaha, at this rate we'll never get to Helase!*

*It turns out it's a burning bull, a creature of magic, it's disinclined to fight and badly wounded.*

*Dune Laith will heal it, at Melysse's request, after which it...*

*[Description] "Cautiously Disgusting"*

*[Action] "Failure News"*

*... wanders off with a loud burp.*

*And feature?*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  8  ] 8*

*And event.*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  5  ] 5*

*So the next day's travel is uneventful. Does Laith go a different direction?*

**_[somewhat likely, 41<=65] YES_**

They said goodbye to the lawman at the base of the hills, where their paths diverged. He thanked them and was on his way, prisoner in tow.

*Okay, uneventful night, and straight on to morning.*

*[Terrain] heavy forest (2)*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  3  ] 3*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  8  ] 8*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  2  ] 2*

*I rolled up some ghost-haunted ruins, of an old temple partly destroyed by earthquake. The ghost's objective is to avoid hunters and it is disinclined to fight. So unless there's weather incentive, my party will pass it by.*

*Speaking of which, weather for yesterday...*

*[Weighted Weather] The same as yesterday.*

*And weather today...*

*[Weighted Weather] Much less comfortable than yesterday.*

*Hmm, let's see what that means.*

*[Dry Season ] Cloudy skies*

*So, it's a heat wave, plus cloudy skies -- thunderstorms brewing.*

*Which means everyone's risking heat stroke.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  1 5  ] 6*

*Using the modified weather rules, that'd put Kai, who is wearing his tunic and scale, at a -2 to all combat, Dex, and Strength checks, plus -2 for fatigued. Seems overly punitive; I think for heat I'll drop the penalties and just use the fatigued track.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  8 3  ] 11*

*Melysse seems cool as a cucumber, probably because she's not wearing any armor.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  4 1  ] 5*

*Poor Dac isn't doing well either.*

*Kai directs them to shelter in the ruined temple from the thunderstorm approaching.*

**Does the storm break before they reach the temple?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 89>=50] NO_**

They rode into the overgrown courtyard just ahead of the storm, tired, and hot from the unseasonably warm weather.

**Is the main room off the courtyard intact?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 17<=50] YES_**

They corralled the horses in the courtyard, under the shelter of a half-collapsed roof, then scrambled through the great doors that once led to a great hall.

*[Nature] A piece of artwork; even odds of original or stolen*

**This is a temple of exiles; is it from after Kai's time?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 9<=10] Exceptional YES_**

So it's fairly recent; the last fifty years or so.

**Does the storm break?**

**_[somewhat likely, 79>=65] NO_**

Kai took a quick look around.

*[Room Size] Trapezoidal [Exits] 0 [Exit Type] as expected [Secret Door?] No*

There didn't seem to be any intact exits, other than the one they entered through. Several massive murals lined the walls; the room was easily large enough for a community to gather for worship.

Kai tossed his gear down in one of the side alcoves, noticing the Melysse was doing the same across the width of the room. He had to admit she'd been bearing up much better than he'd expected. He still didn't trust her, but at least she wasn't useless.

**Is it hotter in here?**

**_[somewhat likely, 24<=65] YES_**

It was even hotter in here than ouside; he took a few minutes to strip off his armor and tunic and immediately felt better.

**Does the storm break?**

**_[likely, 46<=75] YES_**

The sound of raindrops echoed, then with a low rumble the first thunder erupted and the skies opened with the fury of the heavens.

Kai didn't care how crazy his companions thought he was. He raced out into the storm and reveled in it, soaking up the rain and letting it wash away almost a week of grime from the grubby city and blood and the dust of travel. There was an exultation to be found in such circumstances, a wild and pure joy that his people had long treasured.

He was soaking wet and grinning ear to ear when he finally came back in. Dac and Melysse were perched on the porch, under the overhang of the roof, giving him twin concerned looks that he ignored in favor of digging a dry set of clothes out of his bag.

*Okay, evening checks, then resolve when the ghost will make contact; it's disinclined to fight but may want something from them.*

**Does the storm last past midnight?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 100>=91] Exceptional NO_**

*So it's actually fairly brief, which makes sense. But it'll still eat up a chunk of the day, putting them into normal camping time.*

**Does Melysse approach Kai?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 11<=50] YES_**

**_[RANDOM] Move away from a thread "Adjourn Prison"_**

*travel to Helase and to the medusa's lair [Active]*

*So the main journey is about to become a lot harder; because something intends to keep them here until they...*

*accomplish something.*

*But we won't find out about that until we try to leave again.*

*Plus there's only one ghost; it's a 1HD creature.*

*I'm going to bump it up to a more intelligent, dangerous creature, hopefully without going overboard.*

*What does Melysse want to talk about?*

**_[Mythic Complex] Heal Illness_**

It was after dark, and most had gone to sleep. Kai was sitting up, taking first watch as he listened to the rain taper off.

A slight shadow drew up across from him. "I wanted to thank you for letting me come along," she said, sounding hesitant.

He cocked an eyebrow. "You gave me no choice," he pointed out.

Her temper flared. "I had no choice!"

He stared at her until she finally sighed. "My father is gravely ill. I've... I've been such a disappointment to him." She moved a bit closer to Kai; her eyes were huge and dark. "A fortune spent on healers and seers, and we know the cure for his illness... his curse... is to be found in Helase."

"So you see, it wasn't personal," she started, her hand brushing against his knee, her other hand on his bare shoulder as she leaned in.

Kai stood up, shaking her hands off. "Goodnight," he said coldly, and left her there, staring after him.


***


*Scene over, session over, I think.*

*Kai is angry because she reminds him of someone else who used him; a past lover who he thought cared about him but who quickly upgraded to his brother when given the opportunity.*

*So logically, he'll dream about this past lover, and that will give the ghost opportunity to strike at him.*

**Does the ghost attack any of the guards first?**

**_[somewhat likely, 51<=65] YES_**

**Is one killed?**

**_[somewhat likely, 42<=65] YES_**

**Are two killed?**

**_[somewhat likely, 41<=65] YES_**

**Are three killed?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 48<=50] YES_**

**Are four killed?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 43<=50] YES_**

**Are five killed?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 68>=50] NO_**

*Whew. Half the guards gone in a single encounter, murdered in their sleep.*

*Something for tomorrow.*

*I'm interpreting 'disinclined to fight' in this case to mean 'prefers to lull its victims to death instead of overtly fight them'.*

*Ok, whipped together a consuming ghost, built largely on the jiangshi.*

*Since the guards have no stats per se, I use their HD as a guide; the ghost has acquired 4 additional HD, which makes it a 9 HD creature.*

*Its obsession is love...*

**_[Mythic Complex] Transform Benefits_**

*[Action] "Travel Elements"*

*Weird. I got that one earlier in this game too. Quick review says the code is valid; just one of those things, I guess!*

Kai dreamed of her; silky blonde hair, dark eyes, slipping into his bedroll well after midnight, just as she'd done on campaign in Sykos. He'd thought she'd been impressed with his skill and valor, but he'd been wrong.

*Saving throw to see if he notices something is amiss; +1 because she jilted him.*

*The target DC is pretty brutal; 9 plus 9, 18. He's got 2d8, plus 1 for Wisdom, plus 1 for Eidetic memory, plus 2 for his class level.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  3 8  ] 11*

**15; not good enough. Will need to roll a 14 or better. any chance Melysse might try to sneak into his bedroll too?**

**_[somewhat likely, 10<=13] Exceptional YES_**

*Well, that's good at least. I'm going to say the "exceptional" part is that it'll be on next round, instead of following usual protocol and asking each round with a higher likeliness.*

*Ok, now it's the ghost's turn to attack; she's not going to do damage, just drain.*

*It's a touch attack, 1d20 plus 9, plus 6.*

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  11  ] 11*

*Well, it's not like he's resisting or anything.*

*So down one point of Constitution.*

*Doesn't change anything, yet; if he loses one more he'll lose his +1 per level and be down 2 HP.*

*So, top of the order, Kai first, with his saving throw.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  3 6  ] 9*

*... and he's still not figured out what's up.*

*Who goes, next?*

**[Options] melysse, ghost**

*[Choice] melysse*

**So Melysse is an actress and a saboteur and a spy. Does she have skill with daggers at close range?**

**_[likely, 83>=75] NO_**

**Throwing them?**

**_[likely, 49<=75] YES_**

*So she's not a knife fighter, relying on sneak attack and throwing.*

*Is it surprised?*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  4  ] 4*

*She attacks.*

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  2  ] 2*

*Not much to do with that; she has a +2 and +9 for its defense but not much else.*

**Does it notice her attack, since she missed?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 24<=50] YES_**

Ayria wrenched away from him,  her face twisted in a snarl, as she faded away and he woke, confused. Melysse, dagger in hand, was confronting the shadowy creature with Ayria's seeming. Her face was pale and terrified, but resolute.

**Does he use his repertoire in reflex?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 65>=50] NO_**

**Spellfire?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 36<=50] YES_**

The shadow creature swiped at Melysse with a whip of shadow...

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  4  ] 4*

, the barest touch causing the woman to gasp in pain.

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  1  ] 1*

*Fortunately no damage.*

Something -- the strange force that suffused him before -- burst from Kai, fueled by rage and heartbreak.

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  3  ] 3*

*A miss!*

*But there's still Fray.*

*Rolling 1d4 1 times.*

*[  4  ] 4*

It was the creature's turn to recoil as a bolt of black mist scythed into it.

*Melysse's attack.*

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  7  ] 7*

*Plus 9 ac, plus 2 for her AB, plus 2 for attribute/skill. 20 dead on.*

*Rolling 1d4 1 times.*

*[  1  ] 1*

*1 more point of damage; it is down to 6 HP.*

*It's going to try to heal by hitting Kai for damage and drain.*

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  20  ] 20*

*Ouch. Even with its reduced HP that's still a solid hit.*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  3  ] 3*

*1 hp, plus 1 Con, which drops his HP another two points.*

*And it's back up to 7 HD.*

A whip of darkness caressed his cheek and Kai staggered, strength running out of him. The black mist was tinging his vision again, and he felt the same power welling up again.

Almost giddy, he let the magic channel through his fingers, razor-edged bolts of magic flying. Was this what being a mage was like, he wondered.

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  19  ] 19*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  6  ] 6*

*Rolling 1d4 1 times.*

*[  1  ] 1*

*7 minus 2 minus 1 more is 4 HD left.*

*Melysse's turn.*

*Please use standard dice notation, ie, 1d10.*

*Rolling 1d20 1 times.*

*[  19  ] 19*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  2  ] 2*

*3 HD left; morale check.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  8 3  ] 11*

Melysse swung wildly at it and it parted before her blade, wavering for a moment before fading away.

The entire attack had taken mere moments; their slumbering companions across the room not even roused. Melysse stared at Kai, who was feeling entirely not himself, euphoric with the raw magic still channeling through his blood and bones, drunk with the power he'd been denied his whole life.

**Does he try to seduce Melysse?**

**_[somewhat likely, 17<=65] YES_**

**Does she accept?**

**_[somewhat likely, 52<=65] YES_**

He reached out for her, and she fell into his arms, the dagger dropping to the ground, heedless of the black mist crackling in the air around them both.


***


*Scene over.*

*So, one more xp point, for sure -- that was a very dangerous encounter.*

*Additionally, Kai has two more powers to add to his repertoire; dreamwalking and Constitution drain.*

*I'm going to rule since it starts out ethereal and manifests,he technically gains the supernatural ability to manifest, which is of extremely limited applicability to someone who isn't already ethereal. But it might come up and it might be interesting as a Feedback.*

*Session over, too. Next session will either be the next morning, or, more likely, the arrival in Helase; I think that'd be more dramatic by far.*

**Did the ghost ignore Dac because he's too pure, ie, a virgin?**

**_[likely, 91>=75] NO_**

**Ok, fine, it was random luck. I was just curious.**

**_[likely, 30<=75] YES_**

*Ok, new session. Let's do the morning of arrival in Helase.*

*Kai has been surly and out of sorts since they left the temple a few hours after the ghost attack. He has not had a good rest and thus has not recovered any of his Constitution, plus he's angry at himself for sleeping with Melysse, because he doesn't trust her.*

*It's only been about eight hours since the ghost attack; four of their guards were slain of of hand. While they took the time to bury them, they did not linger any longer than that.*

*Let's figure out some things about Helase. First, we know it is ruined.*

**Was it ruined by the same earthquake fifty years ago that ruined the temple?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 95>=91] Exceptional NO_**

**So it was destroyed much earlier. Was it destroyed in the fighting with the mutables?**

**_[near sure, 94>=90] NO_**

*Interesting. So it was destroyed after the mutables won. Let's see if there's a description that might apply.*

*[Description] "Awkwardly Classy"*

*My first thought is that, after the mutable internal war, a handful of mutables set up a class system in Helase that destroyed itself in an awkward way. And what's more awkward that poymorph?*

*Nothing! Hahaha*

*Also, bumping up ration count since we have a third fewer mouths to feed.*

*Oh, and morale check for remaining guards.*

*Rolling 2d8 1 times.*

*[  3 5  ] 8*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  3  ] 3*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  6  ] 6*

*Rolling 1d8 1 times.*

*[  8  ] 8*

**[Options] unsettled, frontier, desolate**

*[Choice] unsettled*

*[Settled Level] Unsettled [Seed] 6*

*[Terrain Type] light forest (1) | heavy forest (2) | hills (3) | mountains (4)*

*[Settlements] ['Abandoned', 'Abandoned', 'City']*

*[Beneath] Solid*

*[Known Ruins] ['temple', 'sewer']*

*Mental note, usually travel days would be modified by terrain encountered; the two heavy forests would have added a day each. Going to say there was enough of a road to mitigate that.*

They crested the ridge and abruptly were staring down into the ruined city of Helase, the once proud city, the jewel of the Dremaeric...

**[Options] nobles, mages, kings, merchants**

*[Choice] kings*

**[Options] pleasure, business, both**

*[Choice] both*

...kings, where generations of Kai's ancestors had held court, loved, sported, and, eventually warred and died.

In his time, it had been surrounded by lush forest, nestled up against the forbidding mountain behind it where the oracle resided.

*[Terrain] heavy forest (2)*

Now heavy forest, given seventeen centuries to flourish, cloaked the surroundings and the city itself. From this vantage, atop the road, scarcely any of the city was visible except the broken spire of the castle.

*[Description] "Lazily Horrible"*

*So, the thought is, one of the mutables ended up with a power that transformed people in some way; I'm thinking some sort of were creatures.*

*[Gender] female*

**Did she know that it wouldn't stick on her fellow mutables?**

**_[near sure, 81<=90] YES_**

*So instead she used it to transform a number of the peasant thralls and train them as an elite strike force.*

*They were able to destroy many of the mutables, or drive them off, but ultimately...*

**Did they turn on her?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 6<=10] Exceptional YES_**

*They turned on her, and all mutables, and destroyed her and drove off or killed all the remaining mutables in the city. However, it was not without cost.*

**Did they lose most of their civilization?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 41<=50] YES_**

*They've dwindled down to a small community of were--*

*hmm.*

**[Options] tigers, wolves, something else**

*[Choice] tigers*

*Ok, so, tigers are nocturnal, and solitary. Going to say this means they tend to live and hunt alone, but have a small enclave most go back to on a semi-frequent basis; children are creche-raised here and taught by elders. They're still human, after all, at the base.*

*So, it being morning, there won't be much activity.*

*The goal here is to move through the ruined city, then take the winding stone path up to the seer's cave. Kai will look for clues as to what happened to him, his allies, or the seer. He hopes that, being a seer, she left him clues.*

*The city must be quite big, since it was the capital. How many time units to get across it, in days? I'm thinking normally it'd take a day to cross, given that it's heavy forest and they're still a decent ways away.*

*[How Much?] Scarcely any.*

*So half a day to get to the base of the mountain; they'll camp there and start up in the morning.*

The trees were silent as they passed beneath, and Kai wondered how many had stood last time he passed this way. It was a hunting trip, he suddenly remembered. Less than two weeks ago, and yet a kingdom's lifetime away.

His brother had been furious when Kai was chosen to visit the oracle. He'd just returned from the hunt, dusty and sweaty and tired, when his father called him in to a private audience. He often wished that, given that he was considered so unsuitable for his position, he'd be allowed to go free, yet he found himself being called to bear witness to some trivial matter whenever his father felt like it.

"You'd send a cripple to do a man's job," his brother, the Crown Prince, had railed to the king, pacing furiously across the marble floor, his hands soft and his clothes immaculate, the ermine and purple robes of a ranking mage a sharp contrast to Kai's rough hunting garb.

Kai had stared at him, as he'd done so many times in the past on similar occasions, as blank and pleasant as if they were discussing the weather, and then he hauled off and knocked the smug expression right off his brother's face. Four years of living rough in the field had hardened him, and it was a solid blow.

Maybe it was Ariya who was the last straw, and maybe it was jealousy, but it felt ridiculously good. The return blast of magic knocked him across the room, sending him spinning into a wall, and it was only his father's roar and quick mage shield that saved him from, at the least, agony.

He'd spent the rest of the week in his rooms, under healer's watch, and then he'd left -- as much under guard as with them -- for the oracle's lair. He'd never seen any of them again, and they were long dust now.

He was still glad he'd done it, truthfully.

*Ok, let's do the city. Do I have a city generator?*

*[Shop Found] Butcher*

*I guess sort of. Let's pull up a city chart for Helase.*

**They are entering from the northwest. Is it a former gate?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 69>=50] NO_**

*Ok, so the wall has crumbled and they're going straight into the city.*

*Which row has the exit to the oracle's steps?*

*Rolling 1d7 1 times.*

*[  4  ] 4*

*And finally, how many time units does the climb to the oracle take? Expected is one-half.*

*[How Much?] Less than expected.*

*So it's a quarter time unit to get up there.*

They entered the city through a gap in the wall, emerging on a stretch of broken pavement that Kai hardly recognized as the polished marble cobblestones of his own time, now worn to a brownish hue.

His mouth drew tighter as they moved deeper into the city, the trees closing overhead and only the occasional ruined wall or half-crumbled building showing they were still within the boundaries of the once gleaming mage city.

*Seems like a good time to roll for an encounter.*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  2  ] 2*

*During the day it's on a one, at night, on a two.*

*[Weighted Weather] The same as yesterday.*

*So still hot and muggy.*

*[Shop Found] Illuminator*

They skirted the center of town; none of them wished to find out what might dwell in the ruined castle.

It was approaching noon as they neared the base of the Serpentine Steps, the seemingly endless stairs carved from the mountainside that went up to the medusa's lair.

**Was there a dedicated building here for pilgrims?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 49<=50] YES_**

**Is it still intact?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 65>=50] NO_**

**Does it have a roof and three walls?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 84>=50] NO_**

**Does it have a roof and two walls?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 2<=10] Exceptional YES_**

*Huh, not sure how to interpret that. The walls and roof are still sturdy and remarkably intact?*

They set up camp in the ruin of the Serpentine Enclave, a small abbey dedicated to dispersing the treasures brought to the medusa. Only the most valuable of prizes went up to her; the rest were given to the poor of the city and used to support the monks, who were never numerous.

It was at the main hall, now little more than a roof with two walls holding it up, that Kai felt reality really hit him. One of the guards was building a fire and tossed a piece of wood on that Kai suddenly recognized as part of an ornate chair, one of several, provided for him and his company to rest on before their ascent.

His knees went weak. What the hell was he doing here, so far outside his own time, so far from his own people, so far from everything that defined him? He sat down, hard, and buried his head in his arms.

A firm but gentle hand on his shoulder made him look up. It was hard to breathe, and the black mist was tinging his vision. Dac gave him a sympathetic look. "I know it's hard," he said. "Must be jarring, to say the least."

**Do Dac's words -- and sympathy -- help Kai past this bout of potential Feedback?**

**_[somewhat likely, 63<=65] YES_**

Kai closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then took Dac's offered hand and let himself be pulled back to his feet. "I'll be fine," he said. "We'll make the ascent in the morning."

The remaining guards each took two hour shifts; Kai retired early, and was grateful to be able to curl up in his own bedroll for the night.

*I'll roll once for just after bed time, once for midnight, and once for early morning.*

*Rolling 1d6 1 times.*

*[  2  ] 2*

**Well, that was quick. A weretiger comes to investigate?**

**_[somewhat likely, 58<=65] YES_**

*[Gender] female*

*[Age - Mature] Mid-twenties.*

**_[Oracle Adjective]Exhaustion_**

**Interesting, she's exhausted. Being hunted by her fellows?**

**_[somewhat likely, 31<=65] YES_**

He'd scarcely put head to pillow when a shout went up from the watchman.

Sprinting out. he found an unexpected sight; a woman, tall, wearing almost nothing and unarmed, her skin a deep tan and her eyes a dark and endless green, was staring at his guard haughtily as the man backed away, spear held up defensively.

*Attitude: Bold*

"I am here to demand refuge," she said boldly. He could see that she was tired, but her stance was unbowed.

"Of course, milady," he said courteously, "Take a seat by the fire and tell us what troubles you." He ignored Dac's double raised eyebrows and Melysse's scowl.
