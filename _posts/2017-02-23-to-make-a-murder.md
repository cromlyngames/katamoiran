Just a quick brainstorm of a framework for running narrative but yet still (slightly?) objective mysteries, solo.

[*To Make a Murder*]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-02-23/ToMakeAMurder.pdf).

It's floppy and not as clear as it could be and is probably not anywhere near objective enough.

My gut feeling is that objectivity is going to be a hard target to hit, but maybe that's just my personal blind spot.

Next step: work up a [narrative mystery gamebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/09/14/pythia-oracle-update/), because I've been meaning to for a while.

Any feedback?
