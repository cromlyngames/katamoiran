11/09: I'm posting this but backdating it to roughly when I wrote it. I'd actually decided not to post it given that I was using my own personal Mythic panel and Pythia core used FU. It definitely shouldn't be taken as a good representation of what Pythia is like now. More as part of the history of Pythia! I should probably break these into more and shorter chunks but I'll let it stay as is for now.

*Being the first part of the adventure of Kai Valeyn, currently a statue with no history.*

<!--more-->

***

*The adventure begins...*

*Let's figure some things out. First, the kingdom we're in.*

*Total area: 303891, subtype: Pre-Crusades, population density: 60, population factor: 4, kingdom age: 1700*

*Total population: 18233460*

*#Cities: 3, #towns: 0*

*City/town populations (8k):  | 72591.0 | 30488.0 | 28353.0 | 220.0 | 720.0*

*Agrarian land percent: 30.0, percent wilderness: 60.0*

*Ruins: 123, active castles: 364*

*So it's a relatively large country, about the size of Australia. Population is relatively high, and it's old! 18 million people, too. Largest city is about 70k people, and there are 123 ruins, just under 365 active castles.*

Kai awoke.

*[Habitations room] Kitchen*

*Encounter? No*

*Treasure? Yes, but hazard*

*Hazard? No*

*Feature? No*

*Macguffin? 16*

Somewhere nearby he could smell something baking, and his stomach rumbled.

**Is he alone in the room?**

**_[unlikely, 64>=35] NO_**

**Is the other person responsible for him being revived?**

**_[somewhat likely, 95>=94] Exceptional NO_**

**Are they a burglar?**

**_[somewhat likely, 95>=94] Exceptional NO_**

*So they belong here, and they're not expecting/responsible for his revival.*

*[Age - Any] Young Adult.*

*[Gender] male*

*[Motive] Generous [4] in context of a prized possession [3].*

*[Motive] Generous [2] in context of struggle [5].*

He sat up and swung his feet off the stone platform he was lying on. It was dark black marble, ornately carved and gleaming.

A sound made him look up.

A young man, about his age, was staring at him with a mixture of horror and...

*[Stranger NPC Reaction] Admiring consent*

Admiration. Kai found it a bit unsettling.

**Is Kai wearing his clothes?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 57>=50] NO_**

*Why do my heroes keep starting out naked?*

It was starting to come back to him in bits and pieces, but he still wasn't clear on what was happening.

Or where his clothes were.

"Ahem," he said. "I seem to be at a disadvantage here."

"Where am I?"

**Is it a museum?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 65>=50] NO_**

**A private residence then. Of a famous art collector?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 69>=50] NO_**

*Interesting. So as a statue, he was being prepared for shipment somewhere.*

"A warehouse -- one of Turan's," the man stuttered. He still seemed overwhelmed. "How are you -- alive?"

Kai shot him a look and leapt down from the platform. The room was filled with crates and paintings, some packed, some half so. The young man had ink-stained fingers and a bill of lading lay near his feet.

**_[Oracle Adjective] Duty_**

**So his first thought is of his duty. Was he part of a team seeking to deal with the medusa?**

**_[likely, 70<=75] YES_**

**Was it officially sanctioned?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 48<=50] YES_**

"The snake demoness -- did it survive? And my companions?"

*Attitude: Combative*

"Demons? What are you talking about, statue?"

Kai controlled the sudden sinking feeling, along with his expression. He took a deep breath. "What year is it?"

*Scene ends here, I think.*

*How many years has it been since he was petrified?*

**Is the scholar speaking a language Kai knows?**

**_[somewhat likely, 71>=65] NO_**

*So there's magic, granting him the language of these people.*

**Is this the largest city in this kingdom?**

**_[likely, 35<=75] YES_**

*Thread Added: discover where his team is*

**Has it been more than a lifetime?**

**_[very likely, 2<=16] Exceptional YES_**

*So it's been many lifetimes. Before this kingdom, which is 1700 years old, was founded.*

*What was his social status?*

*[How Much?] Less than expected.*

*So, he was a prince, but not the crown prince.*

**Was this due to birth order?**

**_[very likely, 35<=85] YES_**

**Was he "the spare"?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 31<=50] YES_**

*So the second son, always in the shadows.*

**Was he also less prominent because of his mother?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 87>=50] NO_**

*So the crown prince was his full brother, no bastardy or remarriage.*

**Did his kingdom fall within a few years of his disappearance?**

**_[unlikely, 44>=35] NO_**

**_[RANDOM] NPC negative "Travel Elements"_**

*So Dac has been fired, for no other reason than the prized statue from the exotic ruins got up and walked away on his watch.*

*It's unlikely, given that it is the dark ages and the city is so small, that it was headed to a museum. So likely the statue was to be a prize for a king.*

**In Kai's day, mutables were known?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 80>=50] NO_**

**So he has no idea what's happened to him. He was part of a unit sent to deal with the medusa. Did one of his allies insult her?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 66>=50] NO_**

**Did it attack them first?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 73>=50] NO_**

**Did one of his allies attack it?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 27<=50] YES_**

**So they arrived to parlay with the creature and -- medusas were oracles, perhaps they were there to ask her a question?**

**_Propose Danger_**

**Seems logical. But it.. took a fancy to Kai?**

**_[very likely, 1<=16] Exceptional YES_**

*She fell madly in lust with him and tried to trade the knowledge they were seeking for him. One of his guards was working for a mutable and tried to assasinate her, and then was turned to stone.*

*This triggered Kai's mutability and the subsequent feedback knocked out most of them; the survivors fled, likely thinking their companions were dead.*

*Leaving him and at least a few of his compatriots as prisoners of the medusa.*

*I think that's plenty of backstory for now.*

*Thread Added: who restored Kai from a statue*

**Is Turan a wealthy merchant?**

**_[very likely, 90>=85] NO_**

*So he's a poor one, or not one at all. I'm going to say he's a gambling man; he finances expeditions into dangerous, dark places and sells the results, over what his agents keep. Things like statues and magical items and carpets.*

**Are mutables widely known now?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 94>=91] Exceptional NO_**

*They're absolutely unknown; nobody has ever heard of such a thing.*

*Amend that; there was a period shortly after Kai vanished where mutables began appearing.*

**Did they attempt a coup?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 47<=50] YES_**

*Led by a charismatic mutable, they attempted to overthrow the king.*

**Were they successful?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 11<=50] YES_**

**_[RANDOM] Move toward a thread "Adjourn Fame"_**

*So they overthrew the king, but were unable to control their powers or themselves, and quickly fell into infighting and then obscurity, along with Kai's people.*

*Kai doesn't know of any of this; Dac knows that the previous civilization was destroyed by monsters in human form who could wield the powers of many different monsters at once. But that's just all legend and superstition, of course.*

*Going to need a nice name for Kai's people and for Dac's.*

*Right now I'm picturing Dac as Kai's Watson, at least for a bit.*

*So it's roughly as if a noble from ancient Rome woke up in the Dark Ages. If ancient Rome was a mageocracy.*

*World building; we know lots now. Medusas are seers and lusty; two Facts to add to them.*

*New scene; let's start out in the offices of Turan and see what develops. First, let's learn a bit more about Turan.*

*[Description] "Innocently Lean"*

*[Motive] Dull & torpid [3], [Focus] food [5].*

*So, Turan's known as "the Lean" but it's in jest; he's actually quite a massive man, prone to gluttony.*

*[Motive] Angry & spiteful [1], [Focus] divinity [1].*

**And he's a bit blasphemous. Kai's people were ancestor worshipers, are these people the same?**

**_[fifty-fifty, 3<=10] Exceptional YES_**

*Hah, where Kai's people gave tribute to their ancestors, these people utterly rely on them and the spirits inside objects and items to provide them with miracles.*

"I'm ruined," Turan breathed, staring at the empty stone dais and then at Kai, who stared back unapologetically. "Unless we can somehow re-petrify him--" The fat man wilted a bit as Kai's eyebrows drew together in a scowl. "Of course not," he said a bit hastily and a bit regretfully.

Kai had spent the better part of the morning talking to Dac about the current state of the world, and he was still overwhelmed by it all. Seventeen centuries had passed since his father last drew breath. Seventeen centuries since everything he knew had collapsed against the furious onslaught of mythological monsters who walked as men.

And now he was in a dusty warehouse, wearing an old robe that was too short, staring at a giant fat man who looked like he was about to cry.

"I promised the..."

**[Options] king, emperor, high king**

*[Choice] king*

"... king an exquisite Dremaeric statue for his new palace," he rumbled. "Thankfully I've not yet sent the painting."

Kai followed his gaze to a large and dramatic painting leaning against the far wall next to a packing crate. The subject was himself, as a statue, sprawled carelessly across the black pedestal as if it were a bed he were asleep in.

Wheels were turning in his head, and he wasn't quite sure where they were going yet. But he needed answers, and the place to start looking was in...

the medusa's lair. He would need to head to Helase and from there into the mountains. And for that he'd need supplies, men, and decent clothes and armor.

"What if we went back to the medusa's cave and retrieved something of equal value for you?"

The fat man's head shot up. "You'd risk that?"

Kai shrugged. "I seem to have come into this world the second time as I came into it the first," he said, one corner of his mouth quirking up. "If you'll finance the expedition, I'll lead it."

*Quick side note; I think Kai, like his inspiration historical figure, was born with a deformity that he's been sensitive about his whole life. My first thought is that it's a lack of magical talent. So, was it simply a lack, or was it an absolute absence?*

*I think for interest, it makes most sense if it was an absolute absence of magic. He couldn't cast spells or activate magic items or do any of the little things like turn on glow lights as he walked into a room -- he simply read as 'not there' for magical effects that weren't directly targeted at him.*

*Now that's he awakened as a mutable, he can activate magical items, with the risk of feedback, and magical effects that are predicated on sensing a human sense him as a magical field instead.*

The bargaining was efficient and ultimately both sides got what they wanted, since there wasn't much disagreement. Kai wanted to be outfitted and on his way to Helase; Turan wanted Kai to be outfitted and on his way to Helase.

*So quick break to update gear and make a script tweak or two.*
