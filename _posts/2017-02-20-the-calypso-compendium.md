I wasn't satisfied with my one page *Lady Blackbird* and *Apocalypse World* mashups. It just didn't feel like I was getting my style across.

So I went back to the drawing board, revamped everything, gave the base system a name ("Calypso"), and put together a compiled version of all the rules and scenarios I've made so far, along with the Traits, Secrets, and Keys I use for my own games. And added a few more scenarios, just for good measure.

So this is [*The Calypso Compendium*]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-02-20/TheCalypsoCompendium.pdf).

<!--more-->

* Apocalypse World derived mechanics, Lady Blackbird derived character generation.
* Characters and mechanics designed to work with most if not all pbtA games from a solo angle.
* A simple soloing oracle that can be replaced with your own favorite very easily.
* A few techniques I use to keep my games' plots "on track".
* Around 15 pages of character options which, with the exception of the Secrets, can be used with Lady Blackbird.
* Six scenarios in the style of *Starfarer*, including paranormal romance, superheroes, high fantasy, low fantasy, science fiction, and paranormal mystery.

Obviously this is a draft and still very much in playtesting, because there is totally no way I could test all this material by myself. But it's pretty reflective of how I personally am solo gaming right now.

Any and all feedback is welcome!
