Here's a d66 chart of Dungeon Dressing pulled from [A Simple Solo Delve](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/simplesolo/). It's sanitized and relatively pithy.

And if you want something a little more challenging and gonzo, here's a [python script](https://github.com/exposit/katamoiran/blob/master/python/charts/dungeon_dressing.py) lifted from Pythia, with roughly 600 elements.

Which is about 200 items less than the "bad things that happened when you touched that thing in the dungeon" list, haha. I should put that one up next!
