I've been working on [a tool](https://exposit.github.io/pythia-oracle/) for solo gaming (inspired by reading blogs like [dieheart](http://dieheart.net/useful-stuff/solo-rpg-resources/) and tools like [the Mythic GM Emulator](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator?it=1)) and [FU](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/89534/FU-The-Freeform-Universal-RPG).

The problem is that, while I love randomly generated content, and it's necessary for me to enjoy playing, it's also a huge pain<a href='#footnote1'>*</a> to flip over to a new PDF (when I likely have a bunch open already) and pull up a dice roller (or tab over to it) and roll for every little thing. Then actually remember the roll result long enough to return to the chart and look it up (yes, this is an issue for me, I'm sleep-deprived and often distracted). All of this is compounded when I'm actually playing a session and just want to see what happens to my characters next so I can write about it! I'm also big on "local files" and "plain text".

From the [Readme](https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle):

>Pythia is a framework to run solo adventures. It uses Python 2.7 and Kivy and will probably run on any platform they will. I wrote it with two goals in mind; first, I wanted to be able to generate content on the fly for my multi-player sandbox campaign while keeping track of that content and second, I wanted to be able to run solo characters through adventures that would surprise me. There are many great GM emulating tools out there, software and print. This is what works for me.

Essentially, this is the tool I use for solo gaming and for tracking and generating random content for my sandbox Godbound campaign. If a player asks me a question, I ask Pythia and whatever comes back, stands as world canon. If I need to know which kingdom an NPC comes from (or which of a handful of names that I like belongs to the Crown Prince) I use the pick one feature. I use it to confirm if my guesses are correct or if mechanics work the way I think they do. Best of all, it keeps track of everything for me - if I roll up a result I think I might need to refer to, I bookmark it or save it in the tracker.

Solo gaming works about the same -- I do character generation using the quicksave, then make a fresh game for the adventure.

Anyway, I'm mostly putting this post up so I have a place (in addition to github) to answer questions and for people to let me know about content they'd like added -- so ask and tell away!
