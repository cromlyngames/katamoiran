		<p>Pythia Oracle (<a href="https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle">github link</a>) is an open source, desktop-based, cross-platform application designed to serve as an "all in one" solution for solo gaming, and to facilitate random content generation at the table.</p>

		<p>It's basically a mashup of a text editor, dice roller, and a ton of random generators. Plus solo oracles (like Mythic) and mapping and character sheets and a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2016/10/23/secrets-and-triggers/">triggers</a> system to give you that old time "real GM" feel, haha.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle/blob/master/HELP.md">help</a> document has a comprehensive overview and detailed examples for each feature and button.</p>
